This C++ program reads a maze from a file, applies Dijkstra's algorithm using a B-tree for pathfinding, and then prints the input and solved mazes. To run this program, follow these steps:

Compile the Code:

Save the C++ code in a file, for example, pathfinder.cpp.
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the file.
Compile the code using a C++ compiler. For example, with g++:

bash
g++ maze_solver.cpp -o maze_solver

Prepare Maze File:

Create a text file containing the maze. The format should be as follows:

php

<number of rows> <number of columns>
<maze data - 0 for walls, 1 for paths,data>1 for path difficulties>

Example:
5 5
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
Run the Executable:

Run the compiled executable:
bash
./maze_solver

View Output:

The program will display the input maze, solve it using Dijkstra's algorithm, and display the solved maze.

Note:
 Make sure to replace "maze.txt" in the code with the correct path to your maze file. Additionally, you may need to adjust the compilation command based on your system and compiler.
